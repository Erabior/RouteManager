# RouteManager
This mod is VERY barebones. The purpose of this mod is to allow people to automate passenger service. This mod does not automate the throwing of switches for the passenger train. You must ensure the switches are thrown properly for the passenger train for the time being. The mod currently does not support automating freight.  More features will be added in the future to expand the capabilities of this mod, but for right now this mod only automates passenger service.

**Usage:**

Select a locomotive (preferably with coaches coupled)

Go to the 'Orders' Panel

Select 'Road' mode

Select all of the stations you want your train to stop at

Press 'Enable Route Mode'

The Route Manager Logic will take over and stop your train at every station you have selected—no need to worry about selecting passengers in the coaches either. The Route Manager will take care of that as well!

Make sure to keep track of the coal and water remaining in your locomotive as there is currently no check for low fuel/water
