# RouteManager
This mod is VERY barebones. The purpose of this mod is to allow people to automate passenger service. This mod does not automate the throwing of switches for the passenger train. You must ensure the switches are thrown properly for the passenger train for the time being. The mod currently does not support automating freight.  More features will be added in the future to expand the capabilities of this mod, but for right now this mod only automates passenger service.

**Usage:**

1. Select a locomotive (preferably with coaches coupled)
    
2. Go to the 'Orders' Panel
    
3. Select 'Road' mode
    
4. Select all of the stations you want your train to stop at. Note: Although you may only see a single station, it is indeed a scroll-able list. (Hopefully will be addressed i a future release.)
    
5. Click 'Enable Route Mode'

***

**Configuration:**

The mod contains a .ini file that allows for some customization of the mod's behavior. Currently there are the following options are supported:

| Section| Option | Description | Type | Example Value |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Core | LogLevel  | Configures internal diagnostic log levels | string | Debug |
| Alerts | WaterLevel| Minimum Fuel Quantity (Gallons) to depart station / warn en-route | Float | 500 |
| Alerts | CoalLevel|  Minimum Fuel Quantity (Tons) to depart station / warn  en-route  | Float | 0.5 |
| Alerts | DieselLevel|  Minimum Fuel Quantity (Gallons) to depart station / warn  en-route  | Float | 100 |
| Dev | NewInterface  | Allows access do DEV features | Bool | False |

**Notes:**

- Dev features are unsupported and listed only for completeness of documentation.

***

**Notes:**

1. The Route Manager Logic will take over and stop your train at every station you have selected—no need to worry about selecting passengers in the coaches either. The Route Manager will take care of that as well!

2. ~~Make sure to keep track of the coal and water remaining in your locomotive as there is currently no check for low fuel/water~~
Basic alerting of low consumables has been implemented as of v1.0.2.0
